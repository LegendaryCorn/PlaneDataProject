Because the dataset is several gigabytes large, I did not attach it to the GitHub repository. I added the file to .gitignore.

You will need to download and put the dataset here! You can do so by following this link: https://c3.ndc.nasa.gov/dashlink/resources/1018/

This folder should have two files: this README and DASHlink_full_fourclass_raw_comp.npz. If the npz is missing, the code won't work!
